## Gems

Middleman and its dependencies are the only gems required. Run "bundle install" to install all of the listed gems. Please run "middleman server" to execute the code.

## Content

### Tasks

The task page, which is by default the home page, lists out the tasks that the user must complete within the security module. It marks each task as complete or incomplete and keeps track of the user's progess.

### Modules

Four modules are listed for the user to complete: History, Best Security Practices, Phishing, and Passwords. **History** details why this security module is important by educating the users on the 2013 Target security breach. **Best Security Practices** include general tips and advice for ensuring that your information is secure. **Phishing** explains this common social engineering tactic, and users must complete a game where they select which emails are phishing emails and which are not. **Passwords** educates users on the policy for creating secure passwords.

### Questions

For additional questions and resources, users can utilize our chatbot, which uses the Watson API, to ask questions that are not covered in the security module.
