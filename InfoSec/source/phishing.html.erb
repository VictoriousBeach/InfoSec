    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left">Phishing is sending spoofed email containing security threats such as a fraudulent call-to-action, request for personally 
      identifying information, or link to sites containing malware. Phishing is a form of social engineering that preys on the trust 
      of an email user. Unlike some other security threats, the frequency of phishing attacks is continually growing. Historically, 
      phishing has been one of Targetâ€™s largest vulnerabilities considering the 2013 phishing breach which caused the loss of 110 
      million sets of personally identifying information. The following are some recent statistics on phishing and email fraud in 2019:</p>
